## Usage

As a user, I can enter a unique expense with the corresponding amount associated and track my overall budget. In addtion to entering decrementing expenses, the user can also add incrementing funds (paycheck, etc.). 

OFFLINE USAGE: This application has the capability to cache data offline. If the user would enter an area with no internet service, the user can still enter purchases and payments into the application, and once back online, the cached data will push to the database.
